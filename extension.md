Extended Sierpiński–Conway Lambda Notation (ESCLN)
Beyond the Omega Function

After defining ω(n, m, a), the Sierpiński–Conway Lambda Notation can be extended through alphabetic escalation, where each successive Greek letter represents a self-iterative hierarchy of the previous function.

These higher levels — denoted by α, β, γ, ξ, and beyond — form what we call the Alphabetic Metaordinal Ladder.
Each letter introduces a new mode of self-reference, generalizing transfinite iteration into meta-transfinite recursion.

Alpha Function (α)

The α function is defined as an iteration of ω itself:

α(n, m) = ω⁽ᵐ⁾(n)

Each iteration of α applies the ω-function repeatedly, producing growth on the scale of the epsilon-zero (ε₀) region of the Fast-Growing Hierarchy.

Example:

α(3, 3) = ω(ω(ω(3)))

At this stage, growth surpasses all finite hyperoperations and reaches into the first transordinal domain.

Beta Function (β)

The next stage, β, represents the iteration of α, creating recursive meta-iterations that move just beyond the ε₀ threshold.

β(n, m) = α⁽ᵐ⁾(n)

Each repetition of β invokes α multiple times, defining functions comparable to those at the ζ₀ (zeta-zero) region of the FGH.

Example:

β(4, 2) = α(α(4))

The β-level marks the point where growth rates exceed all ordinals definable within the predicative ε₀ framework.

Gamma Function (γ)

The γ function iterates β, reaching the Feferman–Schütte ordinal Γ₀, a classical boundary of predicative proof theory.

γ(n, m, a) = (β⁽ᵐ⁾(n))⁽ᵃ⁾

Each additional variable adds another layer of meta-iteration.
At this stage, SCLN⁺ enters the impredicative zone of the Fast-Growing Hierarchy.

Example:

γ(5, 5, 2) = (β⁵(5))²

γ-level functions surpass all systems constructible below Γ₀.

Xi Function (ξ)

The next escalation, ξ, represents iteration of γ itself, extending the hierarchy a step beyond Γ₀.

ξ(n, m, a) = (γ⁽ᵐ⁾(n))⁽ᵃ⁾

ξ is self-referential and recursive at the meta-transfinite level.
Its growth corresponds roughly to functions approaching F_{ε₁}(n) — that is, the first epsilon number beyond ε₀.

Example:

ξ(10, 10, 10) = (γ¹⁰(10))¹⁰

This already exceeds the Feferman–Schütte zone but remains below the region of ε².

Further Alphabetic Escalation

Beyond ξ, SCLN⁺ admits continued symbolic extension through additional Greek letters:

η, θ, ι, κ, … each denotes a new self-iterative level of the previous function.

η(n, m, a) = ξ⁽ᵐ⁾(n)
θ(n, m, a) = η⁽ᵐ⁾(n)
ι(n, m, a) = θ⁽ᵐ⁾(n)

and so on.

Each further symbol extends the recursive hierarchy, but SCLN⁺ as formally defined remains confined below ε², ensuring that all functions are still representable within the countable, well-founded ordinal domain.

Interpretation

Each stage of SCLN⁺ aligns with a specific transfinite zone of the Fast-Growing Hierarchy:

Stage	Definition Summary	Approx. FGH Region	Ordinal Analogue
ω	Transfinite iteration	F_ω(n)	ω
α	Iteration of ω	F_{ε₀}(n)	ε₀
β	Iteration of α	F_{ζ₀}(n)	ζ₀
γ	Iteration of β	F_{Γ₀}(n)	Γ₀
ξ	Iteration of γ	F_{ε₁}(n)	ε₁
η, θ, …	Further meta-iterations	< F_{ε²}(n)	< ε²
Upper Bound

Formally, the ESCLN system is bounded by the second epsilon number (ε²).
In ordinal analysis terms:

∀E ∈ SCLN⁺, ord(E) < ε²

This means SCLN⁺ encompasses all recursive transfinite constructions below the ε² region — vastly surpassing the Feferman–Schütte ordinal, yet still within the provably total realm of ordinal recursion.
